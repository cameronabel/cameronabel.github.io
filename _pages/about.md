I'm **Cameron Abel** - a native Pacific Northwesterner, Concordia University alumnus and proud father.  With a background in chemistry, mathematics and pension administration (*APA accredited*), I have passion for manipulating data and number-crunching.  Outside of work, I enjoy working out, playing video games with my son and spending time with friends and family.
